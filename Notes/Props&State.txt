Props vs State
* Props:
--> props get passed to the Component
--> Functional parameter
--> props are immutable
--> props - Functional Component || this.props - Class Component


* State:
--> state is managed within the Component
--> Variable declared in the function body
--> state can be changed
--> useState Hook - Functional Component || this.state - Class Component
